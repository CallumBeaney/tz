## TZ

### Things to do
- Implement better UX by e.g. filtering subregion by alphabet indexes
- possibly implement using TTY that allows substring-based search if a package exists
- implement in another language if prefer after
- check `sudo systemsetup -help` to see if any other useful CLI tools can be made
